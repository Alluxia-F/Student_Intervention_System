In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and it will be your job to implement the additional functionality necessary to successfully complete this project. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a `'TODO'` statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

This is often known as \"Zero Frequency\". To solve this, we have to use the smoothing techinique, for example the simplest techinique called Laplace estimation.\n",
    "  . Another limitation of Naive Bayes is the assumption of independent predictors. In real life,it is almost impossible that we get a set of features which are completely independent.\n",

    "  Our problem is a classification problem. Naive Bayes is a typical classfication technique with an assumption independence among features. Checked the feature one by one in the data file, it is safe to assume the features are relatively independent. In addition, in our data file, there are 27 categorical input variables. As the strengths mentioned above, Naive Bayes perfoms well in case of categorical input variables. \n",

I am not sure if our observations are linearly seperable. In case it is not, SVM can help efficiently classify using higher order dimensions or transformations. In addition, I chose to test SVM as a classifier due to the relatively low ratio of observations to features (300 observations / 30 features).\n",

    "In practice, the main advantage of SVM is its effectiveness in classification of complex data sets that are not separable by strainght lines or threholds. This versatility stems from the principle that an SVM classifier can accept almost any equation in order to draw the decision boundary. For instance, if the data are not separable by a straight line, an SVM could find an equation for a line that curves or a line with many curves. If the data is still not separable, an SVM could transform the feature data into tree dimensions(or more!) and draw a sphere, cube, or any other higher dimensional shapes as the classification boundary. The variety of equations (called kernels) that can be used for seperation is limitless in SVM, which is the reason it has typically been a very effective classification tool when there are many feature attributes of a data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the most basic form, Support Vector Machines(SVMs) are easy to conceptualize. Given a feature that separates two classes of a data set, a SVM attempt to find the threshold or line(hyperplane) that maximizes the distance between the line and the closest observations of each class. This distance is called the margin. For example, given a feature variable of 'absences' in the student data set, an SVM would find the threhold count of absences that best seperates the data into 'passed' or 'failed'.\n",
